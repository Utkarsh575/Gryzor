# Gryzor

## Inspiration 💡💡💡

We wanted to dive deep into the game aesthetics and nostalgia of the 90s era. And that's what we've tried to make in our project "GRYZOR". Users can also create an account to track their trip history through a personalized dashboard that provides an analysis of their carbon emission footprint.

## What it does ❓❓👁️‍🗨️👁️‍🗨️

You land up in the 90s era, with the gun to win the battle, we have keybinding of W, A, S, D to move the character, space to jump, and left mouse click to fire 🔥, and move the mouse to aim.

- Get to the end of the Level and defeat the BOSS
- You will die if you lose all your health

## How we built it 🙆‍♂️💻🙆‍♂️

- We have used python and pygame packages to make the game, and we have used audio.
- We have implemented a milestone that can be adjusted in settings and will save a milestone in memory when it reaches a defined state.

### Controls 📝📝

Key | Action
---|---
A | Move Left
D | Move Right
S | Drop to a lower platform
R | Quick restart
SPACE | Jump
Left Mouse Button | Shoots in the direction determined by the mouse position
Right Mouse Button |Dash
Mouse Move | Direction of shooting

- Running soldiers will be difficult to see underwater. (Only their head is visible )
- Jump, Right and Dash for a longer distance
- The bird power-up will trigger only if you are walking on a platform while activating.
- Hence jumping directly on top of the powerup will not activate as you are not on a platform. This can be
used to prevent unwanted drops to death
- Trying to drop when on the water will cause you to drown and die !!
- The direction of shooting is determined by the mouse position. The mouse above/below the player shoots a bullet at an angle of +/- 45 degrees 
from the ground.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃🏃🏃

- Accommodating everything together was a really challenging task, but we got through it.
- Creating everything within the time span and making them work was also tough, but our team did it anyway.
- There were unexpected bugs that required assistance from our mentors to resolve.
- Saving and restarting from the state milestone was a bit difficult to implement as we were facing some issues in rendering it from the last point and resetting the bot state.
- Determining the direction of shooting by mouse moment was a bit tricky so we made it work by mouse above/below the player shoots a bullet at an angle of +/- 45 degrees from the ground.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎖️🎖️🎖️

- We dived deep into nostalgia, and the game culture and aesthetics of the era of the 90s.
- We made a fully working game within a time period with aesthetics of the 90's era, with stunning sound effects.
- Being able to get communicate using the Blockchain. Working together as a small group.
- This application can be p[laid by people from normal users to professional businesspeople.

### Rules 📜📜

- Get to the end of the Level and defeat the bot tanks.
- You will die if you lose all your health.
- Each bullet hit will decrease your Health by 1.
- Hitting an enemy unit will INSTANTLY KILL you.

## What we learned 🙇‍♂️📝🙇‍♂️📝
 
- We learned to use sound effects. We implemented an intermediate milestone, we used '90s graphics in a game and implemented them successfully.
- We learned to effectively work and collaborate as a team to make the most out of our time.
- We also learned how to work remotely. We learned how to use new tools for remote work, like VS Code's Live Share features, ngrok for localhost port forwarding, GitHub for collaboration, and how to integrate APIs with the software.

## What's next for GRYZOR 👁️‍🗨️💡

- We are planning to add a multiplayer mode where two players can play side by side and support each other to have some team fun, and also some more levels.
- As we know that most people would like to give as much as they do, and we wanted to do something to try to close that gap.
- implementing a user feedback system.
- Make UI more aesthetic.
